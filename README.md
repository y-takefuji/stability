# stability
Accurate calculations of true associations between variables can often be challenging. Therefore, assessing predictor stability, or feature stability, is crucial for researchers to validate the consistency of feature ranking orders.

There are two primary approaches to conducting stability tests: eliminating either the top-ranked features or the lowest-ranked features. A feature ranking method can be considered consistent if, after removing the top feature(s) or the lowest-ranked feature(s), the rank orders of the remaining features remain unchanged.
